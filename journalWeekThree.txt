Todays labs consisted of a very helpful fun exorcize I found both helpful and challenging ,
 on of my big takeaways from todays was discovering more about finishing a task 
 under pressure and opening my mind to new possibilities on how a task is to be 
 completed.

For example I spent the first 45 minutes of class re-designing the structure
 of how I wanted things to work because one of the big things when it comes to 
 developing is in theory or in your head something can make total sense and work 
 but when it comes to the practical innerworkings of said task things wont pan out exactly how people see it . this is what I really took from todays lesion and hope other people have too because it’s a subtle but decent thing to understand. 
Almost never will the idea on paper pan out to how you theorized it to. And I 
believe after todays lesion a lot of people may have a slight understanding of this.

The last thing I would like to talk about is the second to last example of a 
turnery operator 

"let isStudent = false;
let isSenior = true;let price = isStudent ? 8 : isSenior ? 6 : 10console.log(price);
// 6"

The git book examples that we run through are often good however every 
now and then we get code snippets like these where it seems they would work and 
I 100% understand these aren’t always suppose to be exact examples but even me having 
my slight experience the end where it says “6 : 10console.log” got me quite confused 
because im not use to turnery operators or JavaScript even so im thinking this might 
be how its run or anything you want to continue on or declare will have to be in the 
same line and my brain couldn’t make sense of it until I wrote it down into  vs code. 
The upside to this is it makes people learn and when you figure something like this 
the roots will thicken and it will be very much irremovable in the near future. It’s a 
bit of a toss up.
